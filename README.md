ROS2 Driver

## Overview

The Tallysman ROS 2 Package is a driver designed to facilitate the integration of Tallysman's high-precision GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) & GNRMC (Global Positioning Recommended Minimum)receivers into ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) based robotic systems. This package provides ROS 2 nodes, drivers, and utilities to interact with Tallysman GNSS receivers, enabling accurate localization, navigation, and time synchronization for your robotic projects.


### Features

- Real-Time Positioning: Achieve high-precision real-time positioning for your robots, essential for tasks like autonomous navigation and mapping
- ROS 2 Integration: Seamlessly integrate GNSS data into your ROS 2 ecosystem, making it easy to access and use GNSS information within your ROS-based applications.
- Customizable Configuration: Tailor the configuration to your specific requirements, with options for different GNSS constellations, frequencies, and data output formats.
- Monitoring Tool: Monitor you robot's location a map view.
